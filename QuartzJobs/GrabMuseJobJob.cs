// Copy (implement) GrabKontestsJob for The Muse API
//  You'll prob also have to copy (modify) a method in ApplicationAdoConnection
//		UpsertCompetition() but for Jobs
//		And then the list to single method ig
// If you don't want to do this, just tell me and read through the relevant code
//		I just don't want you to get asked something in the project that you don't know about
//		Also you can have more things you said you did
// I'm fine with debugging lol
// Also yeah setting this up is kinda boring
